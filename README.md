# 22q11wgs

The core computational pipelines used for quality control, annotation, and statistical analysis of the WGS data was coded in python 2.7. The weighted gene-set based analysis and plot of all figures were done in RStudio. They were written by Yingjie Zhao, Ph.D. for the work uncovering chromatin regulators as genetic modifiers of 22q11.2 deletion syndrome.
